            <p>Who we are: The European Citizen Action Service (ECAS) is an international,
                Brussels-based non-profit organisation with a pan-European membership and 27 years of experience in
                empowering citizens.
                ECAS believes in an <strong>inclusive, transparent</strong>, citizen-centric and democratic European
                Union in which citizens’
                rights are at the heart of decision making at all levels and in which citizens are informed, consulted
                and can actively participate.

                Our Crowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing is a way of <strong>solving problems</strong> and producing new ideas
                by connecting online with
                people that you otherwise wouldn’t reach, giving citizens’ the opportunity to learn from others,
                collaborate
                and participate in the decision-making.
            </p>
